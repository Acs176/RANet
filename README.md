# RANet

Welcome to the RANet repository! This repository contains the code for a neural network implemented from scratch in C++ using matrix multiplication. Additionally, we have trained the network using the backpropagation algorithm and tested its performance by making it compete in a Space Invaders contest.

## Features

- **Custom Neural Network Implementation**: The neural network is implemented from scratch in C++, including matrix multiplication operations.
- **Backpropagation Training**: We have implemented the backpropagation algorithm to train the neural network.
- **Space Invaders Contest**: The trained neural network is tested by making it compete in a Space Invaders contest.
